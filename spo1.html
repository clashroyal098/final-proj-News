Axelson is also the Tokyo 2020 gold medallist and Rio 2016 bronze medallist.</p><p style="">A second straight loss left Dahal at the bottom of his group. He next faces Misha Zilberman of Israel in his final group match on Wednesday. The 58th seed Zilberman is also winless.</p><p style="">Dahal entered the Paris 2024 on a universality spot.</p><p style="">On Saturday, table tennis player Santoo Shrestha was knocked out from the preliminary round after he lost his men’s singles match to Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw 12-10, 11-3, 11-4, 11-5.</p><p style="">Santoo is the only third Nepali player to have qualified for the Olympics through a selection tournament after Sangina Baidya (Athens 2004) and Deepak Bista (Beijing 2008).</p><p style="">Paris 2024 also marked Nepal’s debut in badminton and table tennis.</p><p style="">On Monday, Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan could not progress from the first round. She lost her women’s 57 kg weight category Elimination round of 32 Pool A bout to Marcia Perisic of Serbia by ippon.</p><p style="">Shooter Sushmita Nepal also exited the Paris Olympics after finishing 42nd in the women’s 10 m air rifle qualification event.
