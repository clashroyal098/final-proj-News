                          <p><b>At least 16 people tested positive for the deadly disease in Lalitpur, Kailali and Kathmandu. Experts blame authorities’ negligence.
                              At least three diarrheal patients— one from Kalimati in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, one from Tokha Municipality, and another from Gwarko of Lalitpur district—have tested positive for cholera.</b></p><p>Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that the National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out testing on stool samples of diarrheal patients, confirmed cholera infection on Monday evening.“Reports from the laboratory confirmed cholera outbreaks in additional three places in the Valley, including two areas in Kathmandu,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Earlier rapid diagnostic tests too had shown cholera infection in those patients.”With these additional cases, the total number of diarrheal patients testing positive for cholera across the country has reached 16 within a week.Last week, cholera outbreaks were reported in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district and Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City of Kailali district.At least 13 people—seven in Godawari Municipality and six in Dhangadhi Sub-metropolis tested positive for cholera, according to officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. Health officials concede that the outbreak of the deadly disease in several places at once shows that the cholera has spread to multiple locations of the Valley.

                          <p><b>Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years</b><p>The poliovirus has been detected in sewage samples collected from Kathmandu, according to the Ministry of Health and Population, which carried out environmental surveillance of highly contagious disease.

                            Officials concede that the detection of the virus in sewage samples is alarming, as the said disease can cause deformities and paralysis in children.
                            
                            “Presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples has been confirmed by the National Institute of Health of Thailand, the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We got a confirmation report on Saturday. Type-3 polio virus, which is vaccine-derived, has been detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26.”
                            
                            Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.
                            
                            After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials.
                            
                            They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.

                            <p>Seven athletes, one pursuit—the first ever official medal at the Olympics. Be it a bronze, silver or even a gold.

                                Nepali athletes will compete in seven different events at the 2024 Paris Olympics where they will be driven by a single goal—like in previous participations—to win at least one Olympic medal.
                                
                                The Summer Olympics in Paris officially kicks off on Friday.
                                
                                Long-distance runner Santoshi Shrestha, badminton player Prince Dahal, judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan, shooter Sushmita Nepal, swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama and table tennis player Santoo Shrestha will be representing Nepal at the Olympics in Paris this year.
                                
                                Nepal made their Olympics debut in 1964 by sending six athletes—marathon runners Bhupendra Bahadur and Ganga Bahadur Thapa, and boxers Namsing Thapa, Bhim Bahadur Thapa, Ram Prasad Gurung and Om Prasad Pun are Nepal’s first Olympians—to Tokyo and has competed in all Summer Olympics except Mexico 1968.

                                A total of 86 Nepali athletes have participated—in athletics, swimming, boxing, shooting, judo, weightlifting, archery and taekwondo—in the international multi-sport event before Paris, failing to make a breakthrough on each occasion.
                                
                                However, technically, Nepal has not been without a medal at the Games.
                                
                                Tejbir Bura is the first and the only Nepali to get a gold medal in Nepal’s Olympic history.
                                
                                Bura, a mountaineer from the Gurkha Regiment, was awarded a gold medal for his alpinism effort at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France—the first ever Winter Olympics—as part of the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition. It was a mixed team and thus was not recognised as an official medal for Nepal.
                                
                                Bidhan Lama also won a bronze medal in Taekwondo at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. But this was an unofficial bronze medal as taekwondo was then an exhibition event.
                                
                                A total of 120 men and 62 women martial artists from 35 nations competed across eight different weight categories in the demonstration sport in Seoul. Lama defeated Ebenezer Ghansah of Great Britain in the men’s finweight (50kg) class in the round of 16, Choi Chan-ok of West Germany in the quarter-finals before losing to American Juan Miguel Moreno in the semis.

                             <p><b>The current state of the Cabinet is not just a disappointment; it is an outrage.</b></p>
                              <p>Nepal's new Cabinet under Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli highlights a severe underrepresentation of women in public position, with just two women making it to the 22-member Council of Ministers. This marks a regression from the previous term, when women held four out of 20 positions, which is already a low number. Such invisibilisation of women is concerning in a country where women comprise 51.1 percent of the population.

                                The current composition of the Cabinet raises serious questions about Nepal and the newly appointed government's commitment to gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). It is not only the women who have been sidelined; there are no Dalits in Oli’s Cabinet.
                                
                                The recent appointments suggest that our political leaders no longer attempt to maintain the "illusion of inclusion" or "tokenistic representation", given that women’s representation in the Cabinet dropped from a low 20 percent to a concerning 9 percent. It reflects a serious lack of power position for women in political decision-making. If women still lack visible power in such leadership positions, is there any hope of an invisible or hidden power working in their favour?
                                
                                A mirage of inclusion
                                
                                Historically, Nepali women’s exclusion from open spaces of power has been a common practice, with numerous women leaders having to fight battles against patriarchal norms. Women have struggled for the right to vote, inherit property, or even join the so-called male-dominated professions like politics. The exclusion of women representatives from political spaces further undermines their ability to claim any space. If women are continually shut out from high-level positions such as the Cabinet of Ministers, it is unlikely that hopeful youth can see meaningful representation.
                                Nepal seems to be struggling to move beyond the second wave of feminism, which focuses on legal inequalities, to the third wave and beyond, which addresses broader issues of inclusivity and intersectionality. Unsurprisingly, both women in the new Cabinet come from upper-caste Brahmin-Chettri communities, which yet again pose questions about the representation of women from marginalised communities that are severely lacking in top-ministerial positions. Who will remind the patriarchally inclined leaders of the history of hard work and contributions of women leaders to public life, which the former seem so conveniently to erase or forget?

The current state of the Cabinet is not just a disappointment; it is an outrage. It signals a potential reversal of the efforts toward creating a more inclusive and equitable Nepali society. We must question whether our leaders are actively perpetuating the false narrative that 'women are not interested in politics' or 'not capable enough to navigate the complexity of the domain' by erasing their opportunities to claim leadership roles in the first place. And whether this tactic is aimed at further silencing women leaders.

                            </h4><img src="https://assets-api.kathmandupost.com/thumb.php?src=https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/third-party/Screenshot20240723at001706-1721673137.png"alt="family planning">
                             <p><b>Experts warn funding shortfall could trigger a rise in unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal and child deaths.

                             </b></p>District hospitals across the country lack the budget to provide family planning programmes, as the government has not allocated any funds to continue them for the current fiscal year.

                             Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said they have already alerted relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Finance, about the budget cut, warning of serious repercussions including a rise in unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, higher maternal and child mortality rates, among others.
                             
                             “Health facilities won’t be able to continue family planning programmes due to budget cuts,” said Sarmila Dahal, chief of the Family Planning and Reproductive Health Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We believe this might be an oversight and have brought it to the attention of relevant officials at the Health Ministry and Ministry of Finance.”
                             
                             Health officials said that district hospitals throughout the country could soon run out of contraceptives such as condoms, pills, implants and emergency pills due to budget constraints. A potential shortage of these items will lead to a rise in unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal and neonatal deaths.
                             
                             Multiple officials at the Ministry of Health complained that it has been too difficult to convince officials at the Finance Ministry about the importance of family planning programmes.
                             
                             “Most officials think that the country’s population witnessed the lowest growth in eight decades, so continuation of family planning programmes is not necessary,” an official at the Health Ministry said on condition of anonymity, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “But decline in population growth rate and providing family planning services are totally two different things.”</p>

                             <p><b>On a sunny Wednesday, a passenger jet of Saurya Airlines crashed in Kathmandu airport, killing 18 people. The flight captain survives and is recovering.

                              <p>There is a saying about Nepal’s aviation industry: Every new tourism minister is greeted by at least one crash.

This is because the industry is beset by deep-rooted corruption and mismanagement as the country builds airports worth billions of rupees but fails to attract flights. Improving safety remains a far cry.

On different occasions, global aviation watchdogs have voiced serious concerns about the capability of Nepal’s civil aviation authority to oversee safety issues.

In the past year and a half, more than 100 people have lost their lives in plane crashes—despite air travel being the world’s safest and most regulated industry in the world.

Wednesday’s crash is the seventh under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal who fits into all political systems, and the fourth fatal one of his tenure.

Here are a few examples of how policy corruption has paralysed the Nepali aviation industry, the lifeline of the country’s tourism industry and transport in the mountain region.

A few years back, a parliamentary sub-committee headed by Madhav Kumar Nepal had ordered the government to immediately split the civil aviation body due to its dual role of doing business and regulating the sector.
